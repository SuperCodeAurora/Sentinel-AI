# 🛡️ DiamondShield-Sentinel-AI: Local-First Cognitive Firewall

> **"Your AI Bodyguard against the Dark Forest of the Internet."**

DiamondShield is an open-source, privacy-first **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** that runs entirely on your local server. It acts as a middleware between your web application and digital threats, specifically designed to block **Bot Swarms**, **SQL Injection**, and **AI Prompt Injection**.

**Status:** 🟢 Active Prototype (Dockerized)

## ⚡ Key Features

- **🧠 AI-Powered Defense:** Uses a local LLM (Ollama) to detect semantic attacks that Regex misses.
- **🤖 Anti-Bot Barrier:** JavaScript-based challenges to stop automated scanners (curl, Python bots) instantly.
- **🛡️ Privacy First:** No traffic logs leave your server. 100% Local.
- **🐳 Docker Ready:** Deploy safely in an isolated container.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Recommended: Docker)

The easiest way to run DiamondShield is using Docker. This ensures the AI and the Server run in perfect isolation.
