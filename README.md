# 🛡️ DiamondShield-Sentinel-AI: Local-First Cognitive Firewall

> **"Your AI Bodyguard against the Dark Forest of the Internet."**

DiamondShield is an open-source, privacy-first **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** that runs entirely on your local server. It acts as a middleware between your web application and digital threats, analyzing **incoming HTTP traffic** and **payloads** for SQL Injection, XSS, and complex AI-generated attacks.

**Status:** 🟢 Active Prototype

## ⚡ Why DiamondShield?

- **100% Privacy:** No traffic logs leave your server. Powered by [Ollama](https://ollama.com).
- **AI-Powered Defense:** Detects semantic attacks (like Prompt Injection) that traditional firewalls miss.
- **Zero Latency:** Uses optimized local models (Llama3/Mistral) for rapid threat analysis.
